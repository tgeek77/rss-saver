# What is RSS Saver?

RSS Saver saves an rss feed from an blog, podcast, a youtube feed, newspaper, etc. as a local html file or as a local plain text file. You can then use Linux/Unix tools to search those files quickly and easily.
In this first version, there are two python scripts, rss-saver-html.py and rss-saver-txt.py.

## How do I use it?

The command line options for both scripts are the same:

```
rss-saver-html.py [rss feed url] [output directory]
```
